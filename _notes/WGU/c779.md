# Web Dev Foundations - C779

- Went and took the pre-assessment to see where stood as far as knowledge went on HTML/CSS/Javascript. Once I felt comfortable I took it again.

- Looked up that one Reddit site that helped out a lot as far as links, guides, and other online tools that would assist in learning about the course. Here's the link for that one: https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/liixqo/c779_web_development_fundamentals_passed/

- Under "Course Tips" on the right side of the main course screen there is some good study material: The course fun and games has the WebonAir game that has 12 mini quizzes that go through many questions that are related to the exam. Note: they are not exactly from the exam, but the knowledge of knowing the answers helps tremendously. There's also a 20-day study plan that will definitely help others that like to plan and pace themselves. I actually missed this and wish I had known about it from the beginning because it uses the W3Schools online tutorial website that give you all the hands-on training to fully understand everything about the course. 

- W3Schools.com is hands down everything you need for this course. You can use the site to input any scripts and practice any questions from quizzes to check your answer in real time and see why it all makes sense. I really liked W3Schools and actually lost time just playing around in it. 

- Use the instructors' Cohorts that they offer. Mr. K had a really good Cohort that he had all the students answer on the chat to check on their learning. It was worth attending. He goes over exam related questions but nothing that's on the test. I saw a lot of questions that were similar and used different scenarios, but studying his practice exams made it easier to pick the right answer. He sends emails all the time for his cohorts.

- The test still had some questions I've never seen before but used process of elimination to answer those to the best of my ability. Adobe Dreamweaver was there. FileZilla was another one used for FTP. Lots of easy questions and a few that made you scratch your head. 

- Know how to validate HTML; there was one that had 4 HTML pages and you had to find the one that was correctly made for HTML (hint: you REALLY have to check every line to find the error once you get down to 2 answers LOL)

- Where the meta tag goes in HTML

- What an anchor is and what it does; two questions came up. One asked how its used in a tag and another asked what is the symbol used for an anchor.

- Know about copyright, trademark, infringement, being ethical, etc.

- Ordered list and unordered list and when to use them, how are they used. a couple questions came up on picking which ones are used out of several options.

- Know how to go through a code and find where a color is used for a specific line; there will be more than one color in the HTML code (background, text, etc.)  but you have to read the question carefully to know which one to look for.

- Know the difference between CSS and CSS3 and different types of tags when using each one. 

- Knowing how to use inline, internal and external CSS in HTML

- Know when to use iFrame and when and where it is used.

- Some of the questions answered other questions so I would bookmark and come back to them and remember when another question sparked a memory.

C779 - Web Development Foundations

Studying:

I went through all of the provided course material on acrobatiq, but did not read or view all of the linked material. For the linked material, I only reviewed the material and videos that I felt I needed more information on.

 

The Exam:

I felt that the OA was similar to the PA. About half of my test were questions about HTML tags, CSS tags, and HTML forms. I got 4-5 questions about image file types (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.); know which ones support layers, transparency, etc. I got 5-6 questions on web technologies; know how a web server works (client/server model, protocols, security, etc.) and hosting options. I got 4-5 questions related to intellectual property; know the definitions of copyright, trademark, trade secret, etc. I also got 3-4 questions related to editing web pages, know when to use text vs WYSISWYG editors. I had maybe 1 or 2 questions that I felt weren't covered by the course material. It maybe wasn't specifically in the provided material, but not necessarily outside of the boundaries of what the course material should have covered. Some of the questions I got were poorly worded, making it hard to understand what the question actually was.

 

Overall:

I didn't think the exam was that bad. The course material is not great because it links to so much content on the internet. It makes it hard to know what to study for the exam. If you only used the provided course material AND studied ALL of the linked material, you should be prepared for the OA.

--------------------------------------------------

 

The exam seemed to repeat itself a lot, which could be a double edge sword. I had a lot of questions about different hosting types, seemingly focused on colocations. And a couple of questions about different programs like Adobe Dreamweaver and different types of browsers. 

 

I found the travesy videos I sent in my intel to be great for the formatting questions, but I also recommend going through the cohort review material and googling any phrase you're unfamiliar with. Knowing why the other answers are wrong is just as important as knowing which answer is right.

Hi Luis,

 

I found this thread on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pm1kq6/struggling_with_c779_look_no_further/ which was super helpful. So far I've watched the videos and started the flashcards. It also has a link to the v4 material. 

 

Struggling With C779? Look No Further!

Web Development Foundations

Hi all! I just passed Web Development Foundations-C779! It took me TWO MONTHS (and that was because I failed the OA first try, and was so deterred I just stopped studying for an embarrassingly long time. In that time, I figured out how to pass it!!

I want to make it known I have zero previous IT experience walking into this class.

First thing’s first: I don’t recommend reading the material. I know that’s bad! But even my mentors said the material is basically crap. And it’s either so vague (looking at you V 6) or so extensive (kill me why don’t you, V 4) that it’s hard to discern what you should actually be reading and understanding, and what you can skip over.

…So naturally I skipped it all.

Here’s what I did to pass:

I studied a lot of flash cards and did a bunch of quizzes. After failing my OA on the first try my instructor emailed me quizzes, and no joke they are the reason I passed.

Take the quizzes over and over every day until you feel confident. Every time you miss a question, review it. Read the question out loud, and the answer out loud as well. If you miss even one question on a quiz, take the quiz all over again. The whole thing (after reviewing of course). Having to start over incentivizes you to actually learn the material, and get it right, rather than just skimming through to see that passing score.

Flash cards helped, but I learned most effectively with the quizzes.

Linked below, cheers and gl!

:

don’t be alarmed or deterred by the whopping 632 flashcards!! I only went through maybe 1/3rd of this max, and then I started just reading them. It’s ok not to go through it all. It’s comprehensive and exhaustive. Some of the content doesn’t even apply to the class. If you have the Time, go through them, if not, start in the middle and work your way up and down from that: https://quizlet.com/290861152/c779-web-development-foundations-master-test-flash-cards/
