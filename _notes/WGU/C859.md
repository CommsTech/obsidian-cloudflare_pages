# Introduction to Programming in Python - C859
- A program has 2 instructions the processing instruction and the output instruction
- `#` or comment explains code and is not read by the program, it allows code to be more human readable you can use `#` or `"""`
- Python is an object oriented programming language
- A class is like a blueprint for creating objects
- Data types can be
	- Built-in
	- `str()` (string) = Text
	- `int()` (integer),  `float()` (float) = numeric
	- `list()`(list), `tuple()`(tuple), `range()`(range) = sequence
	- `bool()`(boolean) = boolean types
- You can get a data type by using the `type()` function
	- For example
- you can specify a data type with casting
	- for example `x = str(10)` or `y = int("3")` or `z = float(3)`
	The resulting output would be x=10 y=3 and z=3.0
- Strings can be defined with either a single or double quote `"`
- A variable is a format used to set a definition to data i.e. `v = 2 or v = python`
	- you can change variable types i.e. `int()` ---> `str()`  or `str()` ----> `int()`
	- Variable Names are Case Sensitive so Capitalization does matter.
- Numbers are expressed as
	- int - positive or negative whole number. it cannot contain decimals
	- float -positive or negative and must contain at least one decimal
- Strings are anything surrounded by single or double quotes
	- Multi-line strings are defined with 3 single or double quotes at the beginning and end of the sting
- Python does not have a count data type. to accomplish this simply take a string and add a number in brackets
```
description = ("result = ")
a = ("hello")

Print(description)
Print(a[1])
# results after running the command
result =
e
# we get a result of e instead of h because h actually holds a place value of "0"

```

-  Booleans represent true or false
```
print("result for 10 is greater than 9")

print(10 > 9)

print("result for 10 is equal to 9")

print(10 == 9)

print("result for 10 is less than 9")

print(10 < 9)

# Results after running the above command
result for 10 is greater than 9
True

result for 10 is equal to 9
False

result for 10 is less than 9
False

```

- If Statements
```
a = 100
b = 50

if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
else:
	print("b is not greater than a")

# Results after running the above command

b is not greater than a
```

- Bool function.
```
print(bool("Hello"))

print(bool(15))

# Results after running the above command
True
True
```
	- Almost all values are true:
		- strings are true except empty strings
		- any number is true except for the number 0
		- Lists, Truples, and Sets are true unless they are black/empty

- Operators - perform operations on variables
	- `+` for addition
	- `-` for subtraction
	- `*` for multiplication
	- `%` for modulus
	-  Assignment Operators
		- x += 3 or x = x + 3 (SAME)
		- x -= 3 or x = x - 3 (SAME)
	- Comparator Operators
		- `==` for Equal to
		- `>=` for Greater than or equal to
		- `<=` for less than or equal to
- Lists
	- Multiple items in 1 variable
	- Built-in Data types
	- used to store collections of data
	- created using `[]`
	- `list = "apples", "bananas", "oranges"` ( this list also has an index apples=0 bananas=1 etc)
```
list = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges"]

print(list)

print(len(list))

Print("Items")

# Results of the above command
"apples", "bananas", "oranges"
This list contains
3
Items

```

- Tuples
	- Multiple items in 1 variable
	- Built-in Data type
	- Used to store collections of data
	- Created using `()` instead of `[]`
```
tuple = ("apples", "bananas", "oranges")

print(tuple)

# Results of the above command
('apples', 'bananas', 'oranges')
```

- Sets
	- built-in data type
	- Used for multiple items in just one variable
	- a collection of unordered, unindexed  items
	- Created using `{}`
	- Duplicate values are ignored

- Dictionaries
	- Used to store key with value pairs
	- built-in data type
	- have been ordered since python 3.7
	- created using `{}`
	- does not allow duplicates
```
# in this example brand, model and year are the keys, and Ford, Focus, and 2010 are the value pairs
dictionary = {
	"brand": "Ford"
	"model": "Focus"
	"year": 2010
}

print(dictionary)

# Results of the above command
{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Focus', 'year': 2010}
```

- Conditional statements
```
a = 100
b = 200

if b  > a
	print("b is greater than a")
else:
	print("a is greater than b")

# results of the above command
b is greater than a
```

- Indentation
```
def indentation():
	This code is now indented
	And so is this
```

- elfi (Else If)
```
a = 100
b = 100

if b  > a
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a==b:
	print("a and b are both equal")
else:
	print("a is greater than b")

# results of the above command
a and b are both equal
```

- While loop
	- Executes a set of statements for as long as a condition is true
```
i = 1

while i == 1
	print(i)

# Results of the above command
1
1
1
1
# it will just keep going as the command states keep printing as long as i is equal to 1

```

```
i = 1

while i < 1
	print(i)
	i += 1

# Results of the above command
1
2
3
4
5
	# the above command ends at 5 as the number 6 is equal not less than the number 6 value defined in the while statement
```

- For Loops
	- Used for iterating over a sequence i.e. (list, tuple, dictionary, set or a string)

```
fruits = ["apple", "bananas", "orange"]

for x in fruits:
	print(x)
# Results of the above command
apple
bananas
orange
# notice that all results are now on their own line

```

- Arguments
	- information that can be passed into functions is known as arguments
	- you can add as many arguments as you want
```
def name(name)
	print(name)

name("Pineapple")

# Results of the above command
Pineapple
```

Scalar Objects
- int - represent integers, ex. 5
- float - represent real numbers, ex. 3.27
- bool - represents values of True and False
- NoneType - Special and has one value, None
- you can use the `type()` command to see the type of an object

Help Function
```
help(str)
print(dir(str))

# 'str' being the variable/function you wish to get help on
```

### Good to Know Notes
Just passed the WGU C859 Python course. I started it on 9/9/21. Then on 9/22, WGU rolled out massive changes/updates to the Zybook text AND the PA/OA. It was a mess to begin with, and became a nightmare after the udpate. I finally took my OA on 10/7 and passed on my first attempt with ZERO Python or real programming experience prior to this point.

**If I could start over on day one to complete this course in under a month, here's what I'd do:**

**1)** Begin by working through the entire [Codecademy Python3 course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) (make sure to [get the student discount](https://www.codecademy.com/student-center) if you go PRO). I did ALL embedded practice code during the chapters and the "tests" at the end of each chapter (I only skipped the projects that required me to download a python file and work in my computer's local terminal). GREAT practice here, and they made it really easy to understand the thought process behind building solid programs.

**2)** Take the PA to gauge your comfort with the basics you now have in Python. Take note of terms and problems that you've not seen yet so you can focus on those areas next. You have 12 hours in the PA, so take note DURING the PA, because the "assessment coaching report" is TOTALLY USELESS after you submit the PA and close it out.

**3)** Skim Sections 1-8 in your WGU Zybook course materials to learn how Zybook words labs and exercises, as this is the language and problem types you'll see on the PA/OA. Also do one or two of the Labs at the end of sections 7 and 8 to ensure you're feeling good in their types of problems. This should be very similar to what you already learned in Codecademy.

**4)** Work through Sections 9-13 in Zybook fully (13 says optional, but there are actually problems on the OA that require you to know how to build classes, so I don't know why it says optional for that chapter). I HIGHLY recommend working through _at least_ 2 or 3 labs at the end of each of these chapters, as these are more like what you'll be seeing on the OA. You may want to reach out to your course instructor for a call or two to get clarity on things that aren't making sense in the Zybook labs. This helped me a lot.

**5)** Take the PA (you'll likely PASS). The PA gives you 12 hours to work through it. Take the time to google and research each of the problem types that you don't solidly understand (there seems to be a LOT of specifics that are left out of the Zybook, so Google / stack exchange / etc became my source of how-tos for specific python coding techniques). Research and PRACTICE how to do each of the things on the PA that you didn't already learn. The OA is quite similar to the PA, they just tweak some of the problems and add an extra step or a bit of complexity to a few of them.

At this point, I decided I was ready to try the OA. Before I scheduled it, I took the PA one last time with a timer set for 3 hours (how much time they give you on the OA). When I was able to pass the PA within the 3 hour time limit, I scheduled my OA.

**WHEN TAKING THE OA (21 problems with 3 hours):First:** Find and complete the simplest problems right away. Things like "write a program that prints out the following strings". There are probably 6-8 problems that I'd classify as super simple - stuff you'd be able to do in your sleep after completing the Codecademy course.

**Next:** Click through the remaining problems to determine which problems are mid-level and which are appear to be the most time consuming for you. I'd say another 7-8 fit in the mid-range difficulty level. Use your OA approved whiteboard to make note of the hardest for you to come back to last (you'll likely find the 3 hours just doesn't provide enough to complete all the problems). Complete each of the mid-level problems now.

**Finally:** If you have any time left, pick whichever of the hardest (noted on your whiteboard) that seemed least daunting and start plugging away. I noticed about 5 that looked like stuff I didn't see covered in the Zybook anywhere (not at the level of complexity or depth they were asking for in the problem). Things like pulling external data/cvs files into a dictionary to display keys/values, importing a specific function/module from other files based on a user input and then running functions and displaying data from those modules in your outputs/prints.

**Things I saw on the OA that I did NOT feel well prepared for by the Zybook:**  
- Exceptions (try/except blocks): Zybook touched on this over a couple of pages, but did not go as indepth as the problems on the OA called for.  
- Reading and writing to/from files, especially involving CSV, readlines(), etc  
- Advanced work with Python dictionaries, especially when reading from other files/modules or functions.  
- Classes: creating new classes, class inheritance, class instantiation.

_Even without knowing the above listed concepts well enough, I passed the OA with 4 questions I hadn't even touched (the hardest ones), 2 problems in the mid-range I couldn't solve and weren't producing any valid outputs, and one problem that I was in the middle of when the 3 hour timer ran out and I got booted out of the testing application._



### LABS
# 3.13 LAB: Expression for calories burned during workout

The following equations estimate the calories burned when exercising ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20121021230025/http://fitnowtraining.com/2012/01/formula-for-calories-burned/)):

Women: Calories = ( (Age x 0.074) — (Weight x 0.05741) + (Heart Rate x 0.4472) — 20.4022 ) x Time / 4.184

Men: Calories = ( (Age x 0.2017) + (Weight x 0.09036) + (Heart Rate x 0.6309) — 55.0969 ) x Time / 4.184

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output calories burned for women and men.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:  
`print('Men: {:.2f} calories'.format(calories_man))`

Ex: If the input is:

```
49
155
148
60
```

Then the output is:

```
Women: 580.94 calories
Men: 891.47 calories
```

```
''' Women: Calories = ((Age x 0.074) - (Weight x 0.05741) + (Heart Rate x 0.4472) - 20.4022) x Time / 4.184 '''
''' Men: Calories = ((Age x 0.2017) + (Weight x 0.09036) + (Heart Rate x 0.6309) - 55.0969) x Time / 4.184 '''

### Lab 5.16.1 Leap Year
A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:

1) The year must be divisible by 4

2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400

Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.

Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year.

Ex: If the input is:

```
1712
```

the output is:

```
1712 - leap year
```

Ex: If the input is:

```
1913
```

the output is:

```
1913 - not a leap year
```
```
is_leap_year = False
   
year = int(input())

''' Type your code here. '''

if(year % 4) == 0:
    if(year % 100) ==0:
        if(year % 400) == 0:
            is_leap_year = True
        else:
            is_leap_year = False
    else:
        is_leap_year = True
else:
    is_leap_year = False
    
if is_leap_year:
    print("{} - leap year".format(year))
else:
    print("{} - not a leap year".format(year))
```

### Lab 24.5
(1) Prompt the user for an automobile service. Output the user's input. (1 pt)  
  
Ex:

```
Enter desired auto service:
Oil change
You entered: Oil change
```

  
(2) Output the price of the requested service. (4 pts)  
  
Ex:

```
Enter desired auto service:
Oil change
You entered: Oil change
Cost of oil change: $35
```

  
The program should support the following services (all integers):

-   Oil change -- $35
-   Tire rotation -- $19
-   Car wash -- $7

If the user enters a service that is not listed above, then output the following error message:  
  

```
Error: Requested service is not recognized
```


```
choice = input("Enter desired auto service:\n")
print("You entered: {}".format(choice))

cost = 0

if(choice == "Oil change"):
    cost = 35
    print("Cost of oil change: ${}".format(cost))
elif(choice == "Tire rotation"):
    cost = 19
    print("Cost of tire rotation: ${}".format(cost))
elif(choice == "Car wash"):
    cost = 7
    print("Cost of car wash: ${}".format(cost))
else:
    print("Error: Requested service is not recognized")
```
