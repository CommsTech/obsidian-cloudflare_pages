- Under the EC2 Management Plane

AWS Backup (Multiple services)

##### Database restoration options
- Restoring to a point in time
	- Creates a new database instance
	- Recommended to choose the same or similar database instance size
	-  AWS Backup can also be used to restore an RDS database to a point in time
- Restoring from a database snapshot
	- Creates a new database instance
	- You ==CANNOT== restore from a snapshot that is both shared and encrypted
		- Instead, create a copy of the snapshot and restore from the copy
	- you ==CAN== restore from a snapshot and choose a diffrent storage type
- Promoting a read replica
	- When promoting a read replica, the database instance is rebooted

The following is a non-exhaustive list of the tools and technologies that could appear on the exam. This list is subject to change and is provided to help you understand the general scope of services, features, or technologies on the exam. The general tools and technologies in this list appear in no particular order. AWS services are grouped according to their primary functions. While some of these technologies will likely be covered more than others on the exam, the order and placement of them in this list is no indication of relative weight or importance: 

## Analytics: 
### Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) 

## Application Integration: 
### Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) 
**Previously called CloudWatch Events**
**Should have been called** - Serverless data connector
**Use this to** - Connect apps with data from sources

Receives an event, applies a rule, and routes event to a target

![[Amazon_EventBridge.png]]


### Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) 
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Messenger
**Use this to**   - Send mobile notifications, emails and/or SMS messages
**It's like**   - UrbanAirship, Twilio

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) - provides a serverless publication/subscription platform for messaging

Simple Notification Server (SNS) supports the following subscription protocols

-   Kinesis Firehose
-   Amazon SQS (simple queuing service)
-   Aws Lambda
-   Email
-   HTTP(S) endpoints
-   Platform application endpoints
-   SMS (simple messaging service)

For a rate-based rule, enter the max number of requests to allow in any 5 minutes from an IP that matches the rule condition

### Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) 
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Queue
**Use this to**  - Store data for future processing in a queue. The lingo for this is storing "messages" but it doesn't have anything to do with email or SMS. SQS doesn't have any logic, it's just a place to put things and take things out.
**It's like**  - RabbitMQ, Sidekiq


## AWS Cost Management: 
### AWS Cost and Usage Report 
### AWS Cost Explorer
**Should have been called** -
**Use this to** - 
**It's like**   -

- Visualize and analyze cost and usage
- Forecast spending up to 12 months (and analyze 12 months of historical data)
- Provides recommendations about instances
- the Default reports can be customized
- Web ui is free but the API will charge you $0.01 per request

	- Reserved Instances (RI)
	- Savings plans
	
### Savings Plans 

## Compute: 
### AWS Application Auto Scaling 
### Amazon EC2 
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Virtual Servers
**Use this to**  - Host the bits of things you think of as a computer.
**It's like**  - It's handwavy, but EC2 instances are similar to the virtual private servers you'd get at Linode, DigitalOcean or Rackspace.

- “AWSSupport-TroubleshootSSH” installs the amazon EC2 Rescue tool and then checks for and corrects some issues that cause remote connection errors.
- EC2 Status checks do not tell you the status of an EBS volume

Troubleshooting EC2 Instances
-   Verify CodeDeploy agent is installed and running on the instance
-   Verify the correct IAM instance profile is attached to the instance
-   Verify the tags are set properly

![[EC2_Resources.PNG]]
- Cloudwatch metrics for EC2 Instances
	- CPU utilization
		- Percentage of allocated CPU
	- Burst
		- CPU Credit usage balance
	- Network I/O
		- Bytes/ number of packets
	- Status checks
		- for instance and systems
- **RAM is not included in default metrics for EC2**
	- You must install and configure CloudWatch agent on the EC2 Instance
	- This agent will push memory analytics
	- you will need to create a special IAM role to configure the agent
	
![[EC2_instance_Type.PNG]]

Instance Types
- General Purpose (M, T, A)
- Memory Optimized (R, X)
- Compute Optimized (C)
- Storage Optimized (I, D, H)
- Accelerated Computing (P, G, F)

Storage Options
- EBS Volume
	- Block storage
- Instance Store
	- Better I/O Performance 
	- Ephermeral storage
	- All data is lost if stopped or terminated
	- should only be used with scratch or temporary data
	- Size is fixed and you are responsible for backups


### Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling 
### Amazon EC2 Image Builder 
### AWS Lambda
**Should have been called** - AWS App Scripts
**Use this to** - Run little self contained snippets of JS, Java or Python to do discrete tasks. Sort of a combination of a queue and execution in one. Used for storing and then executing changes to your AWS setup or responding to events in S3 or DynamoDB.
**It's like**   - 

Compute Savings plans should be used when lambda usage is required

## Database: 
### Amazon Aurora 
**Should have been called** - 
**Use this to** - 
**It's like** - 

Aurora uses database clusters

- Backups 
	- Cluster volume backed up automatically during a daily preferred backup window
	- Retains restore data for the backup retention period (Defaults to 1 day)
	- Backups are continous and incremental
	- Manual snapshots are possible, and you can create a new database cluster from a snapshot
- Restore
	- Create a new database cluster from a backup or a snapshot
	- Can restore to any period of time in the backup retention period
	- Can also clone a database from one cluster to another
- Backtracking
	- Feature must be enabled when the database cluster is created
	- "Rewinds" the database cluster to a time you specify
		- Allows you to immediantly undo a destructive action
	- Does NOT require a new database cluster and rewind happens within minutes
	- Can use this repeatedly back and forth
	- Backtrack window is limited to 72 hours
	
### Amazon ElastiCache
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Memcached
**Use this to**  - Be your app's Memcached or Redis.
**It's like**   - Redis to Go, Memcachier

- With Amazon ElasticCache Memcached engine you cannot modify the node type. The way to scale up is to create a new cluster and specify the new node type. You can however, update the endpoint config in your application to point to the new endpoint.
- When using a single shard with cluster mode disabled you can create up to 5 replicas and the replicas can be in separate AZ as this adds High Availability with auto-failover.
- You can scale Elasticcache and Memcached clusters horizontally or vertically.

### Amazon RDS  
**Should have been called**  -  Amazon SQL
**Use this to** - Be your app's Mysql, Postgres, and Oracle database.
**It's like**  - Heroku Postgres

RDS handles failovers automatically. The primary DB will automatically switch to the standby replica if any of the following problems occur:
-   An AZ Outage
-   The Primary DB instance Fails
-   The DB instances server type is changed
-   The OS of the DB instance is undergoing patching
-   A manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using “Reboot with Failover”

RDS service includes backups, patching, failover detection, and recovery

RDS Multi-AZ Failover occurs in the following situations:
-   An Availability zone outage
-   The primary DB instance fails
-   The DB instance type is changed
-   The OS of the DB instance is undergoing patching
-   A Manual failover of the DB instance was initiated using a "Reboot with Failover"

DB Instance classes
- Standard (m)
- Memory Optimized (r, x)
- Burstable (t)

RDS Storage types 
- General perpose SSD (solid state drive)
	- Cost Effective
	- Can burst up to 3000 IOPS
- Provisioned IOPS SSD
	- Low Latency
	- Consistent throughput
- Magnetic
	- Kept for backwards compatability

- The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a filesystem interface to connect multiple AZ to a single filesystem using the NFS protocol
- After creating a cluster, you can immediately run queries by using the query editor on the amazon redshift console.
- One of the limitations of the cluster query editor is that you cannot use it with enhanced VPC routing

The Following are a few reasons why an instance might immediately terminate:
-   You’ve reached your EBS Volume limit
-   An EBS snapshot is corrupt
-   The root EBS volume is encrypted and you don’t have permission to access the key
-   The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part.

There are two ways to scale a database when you need the capacity to serve reads.
1.  Use a read replica
2.  Modify the RDS instance type to a larger instance.

The AWS config encrypted-volumes rule checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted

You can run volume gateways in two modes Cached and Stored.
- With cached volumes, the storage gateway service stores full volume in its S3 service bucket and a portion of the volume (recently accessed) in the gateway local cache

Amazon S3 inventory provides CSV output files that list your objects and their corresponding metadata on a daily or weekly basis for an S3 bucket or a shared prefix. The inventory reports will provide a definitive answer to the admin for how many objects are in a bucket.

To add HA to an existing RDS instance go into the console and enable multi-AZ

To share a snapshot with another account you must create a manual RDS snapshot with the create-db-snapshot command and share it to the destined account. Then they create a copy of their account.

Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your Database instances during the backup window of your instance.

Amazon RDS provides metrics in real-time for the OS that your DB instance runs on. You can view the metric for your DB instance using the console. Enhanced monitoring JSON output from Cloudwatch logs in a monitoring system of your choice.


## Management, Monitoring, and Governance: 
### AWS CloudFormation 
**Should have been called**  - Amazon Services Setup
**Use this to**  - Set up a bunch of connected AWS services in one go.
**It's like**   - Openstack 

| Component | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Stack | A collection of resources to deploy as a group |
| Template | A JSON or YAML File that describes the stack |
| Change Set | Preview/Summary of proposed changes and how they will impact currently running resources |
| Stackset | Create, Update, delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions. (Stacks that live across multiple accounts using the same template) |
| Nested Stacks | stacks created as part of other stacks. (Stacks that are contained within a Parent Stack) |


#### Deployment Options
Options for Sequencing and Dependencies

-   DependsOn
    -   Used to Specify that the creation of one resource follows another
    -   Controls the order in which your resources are created
    -   Does  not wait for signals of success or failure before moving on
-   Wait Conditions
    -   Pauses execution of a cloudformation template and waits for a success signal before continuing template execution
    -   Waits for success signals before resuming execution of CloudFormation template

#### Templates
- You can use the optional parameters section to customize your templates. Parameters enable you to input custom values to your templates each time you create or update a stack.
- A template is a YAML or JSON template used to describe the end-state of the infrastructure you are provisioning or changing
- After creating the template, you upload it to CloudFormation directly or using Amazon S3
- Cloudformation reads the template and makes the API calls on your behalf.
- The resulting resources are called a "Stack"
- Logical IDs are used to reference resources within the template
- Physical IDs identify resources outside of AWS CloudFormation templates, but only after the resources have been created.

#### Stacks
- Deployed resources based on templates
- Create, update and delete stacks using templates
- Deployed through the Management Console, CLI or APIs
- Stack Creation errors:
	- Automatic rollback on error is enabled by default
	- you will be charged for resources provisioned even if there is an error


#### Stack Sets
- AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation
- Using an administrator account, you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts across specified regions
- An Administrator account is the AWS account in which you create stack sets
- A Target account is the account into which you create, update, or delete on or more stacks in your stack set

#### Change Sets
- Cloudformation change sets allows you to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your currently running resources.

#### Troubleshooting
- The `Rollback_Complete` status indicates successful removal of one or more stacks after a failed stack creation
- A “Stack Set” lets you create stacks in AWS accounts across regions by using a single cloud formation template

Delete Stack fails :
-   Some resources must be empty before deleting I.E. S3 buckets
-   Missing permissions to delete
-   Termination protection may be enabled on the stack
-   For nested stacks, the root stack has protection enabled

Rollback Failed :
-   Changes were made to resources outside of cloudformation
-   insufficient permissions
-   limitation error

### AWS CloudTrail
**Should have been called**  - Amazon API Logging
**Use this to**  - Log who is doing what in your AWS stack (API calls).
**It's like**   - 

- To determine whether a log file was modified, deleted, or unchanged after cloudtrail delivered it you can use cloudtrail log files integrity validation
- For an alarm to go off when there are no healthy instances the `HealthyHostCount` metric is `< = 0`

#### Cloudtrail Setup

Step 1 - Choose trail attributes

Logs - Records of events

Amazon Cloudwatch EC2 Metrics - (Under the monitoring tab)

**A ==detailed monitor== must be enabled if an alarm is to trigger in under 5 mins.**

A Cloudwatch alarm monitors a metric, and when defined thresholds are met or exceeded the alarm triggers an action.

You can create a Cloudwatch dashboard to display custom metrics by adding a widget and choosing metrics from the custom namespace.

Utilization data is not recorded in log files in Cloudwatch logs.

To store logs of terminated instances you must configure a unified Cloudwatch agent to stream the logs to Cloudwatch logs. This will ensure all logs are up to date at the point of termination.

VPC flow logs can be enabled on either the NAT Gateway ENI or the VPC. Cloudwatch insights can then be used to filter data based on source IP

Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. There the access logs should be recorded in a separate, dedicated bucket. Access logs include information such as requests, the remote IP, and the Bucket being accessed.

In AWS Organizations SCP are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization

The SSM Agent must be installed on the instances you want to connect to through sessions a custom AMI may not have an SSM agent i nstalled and an administrator may need to install it. By default, SSM doesn’t have permission to perform actions on your instances.

For a workflow to open the AWS management console on behalf of a user an AWS SSO endpoint is required instead of directly calling the `AssumeRole with SAML API`. The endpoint calls the API for the user and returns a URL that automatically redirects the users browser to the AWS management console.

AD Connector is designed to give you an easy way to establish a trust relationship between your active directory and AWS.

The `AMI ID does not exist` indicates that the AMI might have been deleted after creating the launch config. As it is not possible to update the launch configs, a new config must be created with a valid AMI. It can also be an indicator that the AMI does not exhist in that region.

AWS system manager parameter store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management.

		C- Logging in to EC2 each night might work but would be time consuming and as outlined in the question does not meet the Least amount of effort requirement
		D- CPU utilization metric does not capture the process IDs

34) A SysOps administrator configured AWS Backup to capture snapshots from a single Amazon EC2 instance that has one Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume attached. On the first snapshot, the EBS volume has 10 GiB of data. On the second snapshot, the EBS volume still contains 10 GiB of data, but 4 GiB have changed. On the third snapshot, 2 GiB of data have been added to the volume, for a total of 12 GiB. How much total storage is required to store these snapshots?  

	A. 12 GiB
	B. 16 GiB
	C. 26 GiB
	D. 32 GiB
	Answer:
		B
		References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html#how_snapshots_work
		Note: This is more of a Math question and knowing the snapshot sizing. In this example we start with 10 GiB of data. the second snapshot contains 10 BUT only 4 GiB of data has changed so the remaining 6 would not have to be stored. Therefore we are at 14 GiB after the Second Snapshot. At the third snapshot which contains 12 GiB of data only 2 GiB was added so we only have to add 2 to the total storage requirement adding up to 16 GiB of required storage.

The application logs show that the performance issues occur when users are searching for information. The same search is rarely performed multiple times. A SysOps administrator must improve the performance of the platform by using a solution that maximizes resource efficiency.  Which solution will meet these requirements?  

	A. Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster in front of the DB cluster. Modify the application to check the cache before the application issues new queries to the database. Add the results of any queries to the cache.
	B. Deploy an Aurora Replica for the DB cluster. Modify the application to use the reader endpoint for search operations. Use Aurora Auto Scaling to scale the number of replicas based on load.
	C. Use Provisioned IOPS on the storage volumes that support the DB cluster to improve performance sufficiently to support the peak load on the application.
	D. Increase the instance size in the DB cluster to a size that is sufficient to support the peak load on the application. Use Aurora Auto Scaling to scale the instance size based on load.

	B. List any instances with failed system status checks using the AWS Management Console.
	C. Monitor AWS CloudTrail for StopInstances API calls.
	D. Review the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.
	Answer:
		D
		References: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-degraded-hardware/
		Notes: If a hardware malfunction occurs, then Amazon EC2 tags the specific hardware as faulty. Any instances that are running on the hypervisor of the faulty hardware are moved to healthy hardware. During the transition to new hardware, the Amazon EBS-backed instances are stopped and instance store-backed instances are terminated. Amazon EC2 sends a notification through email and to your Personal Health Dashboard informing you of the hardware degradation and of the upcoming instance stop or termination.

62) A data analytics application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance. A SysOps administrator must add custom dimensions to the metrics collected by the Amazon  CloudWatch agent. How can the SysOps administrator meet this requirement?  

	A. Create a custom shell script to extract the dimensions and collect the metrics using the Amazon CloudWatch agent.
	B. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to evaluate the required custom dimensions and send the metrics to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
	C. Create an AWS Lambda function to collect the metrics from AWS CloudTrail and send the metrics to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group.
	D. Create an append_dimensions field in the Amazon CloudWatch agent configuration file to collect the metrics.
	Answer:
		D
		References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html
		Notes: In custom metrics, the --dimensions parameter is common. A dimension further clarifies what the metric is and what data it stores. You can have up to 30 dimensions assigned to one metric, and each dimension is defined by a name and value pair

63) A company stores its data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company is required to classify the data and find any sensitive personal information in its S3 files.  Which solution will meet these requirements?  

	A. Create an AWS Config rule to discover sensitive personal information in the S3 files and mark them as noncompliant.
	B. Create an S3 event-driven artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) pipeline to classify sensitive personal information by using Amazon Rekognition.
	C. Enable Amazon GuardDuty. Configure S3 protection to monitor all data inside Amazon S3.
	D. Enable Amazon Macie. Create a discovery job that uses the managed data identifier.
	Answer:
		D
		References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/data-classification.html
		Notes: To discover sensitive data with Amazon Macie, you create and run sensitive data discovery jobs. A sensitive data discovery job analyzes objects in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets to determine whether the objects contain sensitive data, and it provides detailed reports of the sensitive data that it finds and the analysis that it performs. By creating and running jobs, you can automate discovery, logging, and reporting of sensitive data in S3 buckets.

64) A company hosts a web portal on Amazon EC2 instances. The web portal uses an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Amazon Route 53 for its public DNS service. The ELB and the EC2 instances are deployed by way of a single AWS CloudFormation stack in the us-east-1 Region. The web portal must be highly available across multiple Regions.  Which configuration will meet these requirements?  

	A. Deploy a copy of the stack in the us-west-2 Region. Create a single start of authority (SOA) record in Route 53 that includes the IP address from each ELB. Configure the SOA record with health checks. Use the ELB in us-east-1 as the primary record and the ELB in us-west-2 as the secondary record.
	B. Deploy a copy of the stack in the us-west-2 Region. Create an additional A record in Route 53 that includes the ELB in us-west-2 as an alias target. Configure the A records with a failover routing policy and health checks. Use the ELB in us-east-1 as the primary record and the ELB in us-west-2 as the secondary record.
	C. Deploy a new group of EC2 instances in the us-west-2 Region. Associate the new EC2 instances with the existing ELB, and configure load balancer health checks on all EC2 instances. Configure the ELB to update Route 53 when EC2 instances in us-west-2 fail health checks.
	D. Deploy a new group of EC2 instances in the us-west-2 Region. Configure EC2 health checks on all EC2 instances in each Region. Configure a peering connection between the VPCs. Use the VPC in us-east-1 as the primary record and the VPC in us-west-2 as the secondary record.

67) A new application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and accesses data in an Amazon RDS database instance. When fully deployed in production, the application fails. The database can be queried from a console on a bastion host. When looking at the web server logs, the following error is repeated multiple times:  *** Error Establishing a Database Connection  Which of the following may be causes of the connectivity problems? (Choose two.)  

	A. The security group for the database does not have the appropriate egress rule from the database to the web server.
	B. The certificate used by the web server is not trusted by the RDS instance.
	C. The security group for the database does not have the appropriate ingress rule from the web server to the database.
	D. The port used by the application developer does not match the port specified in the RDS configuration.
	E. The database is still being created and is not available for connectivity.
	Answer:
		C,E
		References: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-cannot-connect/
		Notes: The RDS DB instance is in a state other than available, so it can't accept connections. The source you use to connect to the DB instance is missing from the sources authorized to access the DB instance in your security group, network access control lists (ACLs), or local firewalls. The wrong DNS name or endpoint is used to connect to the DB instance. The Multi-AZ DB instance failed over, and the secondary DB instance uses a subnet or route table that doesn't allow inbound connections. The user authentication is incorrect because of one of the following reasons: You're using an incorrect user name or password at the database level to access the instance from the DB client. You don't have the required database permissions to access the instance. The client is running on a version that's incompatible with the database version.

# Tips and Tricks
Completion of C924 requires you to pass the AWS SysOps Associate certification. 


## Know the following


-   Using a Security Role or Group is more secure (and better IT practice in general) than sharing an account or embedding credentials in a script.
    
-   Route 53, knowing when you can use Alias vs CNAME records.
    
-   If you want to use a bucket as a static website, it must have the same name as the domain and security groups configured correct
    
-   Generally the most "outward facing service" will hold the logs for a service. If you are trying to trace HTTP logs for a bucket behind a CloudFront distribution, the logs will be in CloudWatch logs.
    
-   Are the logs for so and so in CloudWatch, CloudTrail, AWS Config, or etc?
    
-   Ugh. Stacks, Stack Sets, Embedded Stacks, or maybe just create a whole new stack bro.
    
-   Change Sets, AWS Config, AWS Organizations

C924 is based around the completion of the AWS Sysops Associate certification. At least in the cloud program, this was one of the hardest courses and the one I spent the most time losing sleep over. That said, IT IS doable, even if you have zero hands on experience in AWS. I passed it on my first try with a score of ~880/1000, where the cut score is 720. It takes preparation, determination, and maybe a little positive thinking as I felt a few times that I would not be able to make it through this class. In the end, the test was not NEAR as bad as I had built it up.

These are my tips on the class to assist where possible:

First off, to give you an understanding of my experience going in - I had zero direct AWS experience or any other cloud environment, full stop. I also reached this class before Cloud Practitioner became apart of the degree. Having that background WOULD HAVE HELPED, so if you are in a position to wait to do that one first, I would recommend it.

What I did have is decent general IT experience, working in the field at various levels for 15+ years. That experience was key, as this class differs from many in the program and other certifications. This isn't about memorizing values, limits, or nonsensical information. This certification is all about understanding how the various AWS services piece together and how you might troubleshoot/configure them to solve/avoid issues. Generally having a good foundational knowledge helped. For that reason, I'd definitely recommend putting this at the end of your journey at WGU.

Also of note - I took version 1 of the certification. Early 2021, the new version (v2) goes into beta and eventually becomes the standard. This version introduces a lab simulation of some sort apparently, so some of my guidance may become out of date at that point.

**Resources Used**

I did not use WGU's provided material. It consists of a few ucertify pages with external links to Amazon AWS Academy text, PluralSight videos, and the like. I spent plenty of time reading what was making people successful on [r/AWSCertifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/) and went that route. I also did not use the Ucertify practice tests - if Chatter can be trusted, they are not representative of the real exam.

Stephane Mareek's udemy course (~19 hours, $10-20). If I did it again, I'd 2x speed thru his hands on demos. You don't need to know HOW to do anything, only the WHY you'd do something (Again, this might change with v2)

Jon Bonso/Tutorials Dojo's AWS Sysops practice tests (5 tests, $10). These tests are great, just wonderful at preparing you. The key with these is they tell you, IN GREAT DETAIL, why each answer is right or wrong. I found these slightly more difficult than the real deal, which is a good thing - the practice tests had me prepared. You also get a code to redeem on their website to use custom tests and "Learn" mode. I mention how that helped below.

AWS.training's official exam readiness course (1.5 hours, free). This was actually the best at understanding how Amazon words their questions and doing the process of elimination on bad answers. This video was hands down the best resource for really just becoming GOOD at AWS questions. The instructor does a good job going thru each question and answer. I can't recommend this one high enough.

Pluralsight's Demystifiying AWS Sysops Exam (1.5 hours, free w/WGU login). I'm not entirely certain how helpful I found this to be honest. It is kind of a brief run thru of a bunch of topics without really any depth. Still, its free and I was immersed by AWS so why not.

FreeCodeCamp's AWS Associate Course (14 hours, free). This is a YouTube video that goes into exceptional detail in every service. The top Youtube comment has bookmarks to each section. I didn't watch this in full, but I did review some areas that I felt I needed more depth on. I feel like in general, this covers topics in a different format than Stephane's course in maybe a bit more depth than necessary, but if you are struggling with concepts, its not a bad place. One nice thing is at the end of every section, they have a brief run through of each service.

Tutorials Dojo AWS Study Materials/Cheat Sheets - These are available for free on their website, but you can also buy an eBook/pdf of all of them together for $6.99. These were helpful, if a little verbose, at explaining each service (377 pages). I didn't really utilize this as much as I thought, but I wouldn't say it was a waste either. One nice thing is it has explanation of why you'd use service A over service B with comparisons. With a lot of services in AWS that are similar, that was at least helpful. I'd probably just utilize their free pages if I'd do it again, but $7 didn't break the bank for a one stop PDF resource.

**Study Time**

To prepare, I watched Stephane's course in full. I did speed up the moments where he does hands on - there are occasionally nuggets of good info in these hands on, but in general the test (in its v1 form) doesn't expect you to know how to do things, just why. That gets you thru the nearly 20 hours a bit faster. I took extensive notes - probably more than any other class. Again, don't totally lose yourself on the tiny details - you want to understand primarily four things for each AWS service:

1.  What the service does
    
2.  When you'd use the service
    
3.  How to troubleshoot the service
    
4.  How it interfaces with other AWS services
    

I then attempted the first Bonso practice test and failed at 64%. This was a bit of a gut check but not totally unexpected. I followed that up by reviewing my notes and rewatching some content in Stephane's course. I immediately noticed that a few topics are not covered at all in the course: Lambda, DynamoDB, SES, and SNS. All of these except DynamoDB showed up in _basic_ ways on the exam. You need to at least understand what they do.

Test 2 w/Bonso, 58%. Gut check #2. Test 3: 63%, "oh my god I've prepared so much yet I'll never pass this".

I now moved onto the other video resources, the Pluralsights "Demystifying" course but most importantly, the AWS.training exam prep. That video was very, very helpful at approaching the tests with a different mindset. Instead of looking for the correct answer first, I immediately looked for the _bad_ answers. This process of elimination really made a difference in my approach. I revisited my notes, used the Tutorial Dojo summary/cheat sheets on services, and reviewed the end of section reviews from the FreeCodeCamp youtube series for a couple of them.

Test #4 - 81%. "Holy $#*& I **CAN** pass this!"

Once I knew I had the potential, I redeemed a code from Tutorial Dojo's/Bonso's practice tests that was sent to my Udemy messages area that allowed me to access the same tests on their website. Their website has the tests in a review mode, similar to the "Learn" feature of Ucertify in other WGU classes. I started running through smaller chunks of practice tests, 30 questions, and having it explain if I got the question right/wrong and why immediately. I find this helpful as a last prep stage. The caution here is you don't want to just learn the answers and memorize and skew your test results. This is why I'd recommend waiting until you are CLOSE to the point of taking the exam and using this as a last step to prepare. I ran thru 4 or 5 sets like this, again reading and understanding the great explanation. After that, I felt prepared as I was consistently getting 80% on this micro-tests and didn't feel it was due to memorization.

**Test Tips**

As mentioned, the big one is going in with the process of elimination. Find the bad answers and make your life easier, everything is multiple choice. You also have a LOT of time, I never felt rushed.

You really need to know EC2, load balancing, and auto scaling group inside and out. A near majority of questions are setup with, "You have x number of EC2 instances behind an ELB, which are setup in an auto scaling group, and then.....". Understanding the basics here is key.

Also as mentioned above, troubleshooting. In Stephane's course, he points out troubleshooting steps and common failures for nearly every service. KNOW THEM!

Another general call out - watch for words like HIGHLY resilient in questions. If you see that, the answer can't have a single point of failure. I caught myself on these at least twice where two answers were technically correct, but not if you consider highly resilient.

Things that came up a lot: CloudWatch monitoring is big. Understand all the systems and what they shoot to Cloudwatch.

Understanding Systems Manager and its components (param store, run command).

AWS Config vs Systems Manager was probably a couple questions.

CloudFormation was also huge. Lot of questions about new stacks, stack rollsbacks, mappings, deletionpolicy, updatepolicy.

Understanding S3 basics, Glacier, lifecycle policies, storage classes.

CloudFront was on a few questions.

RDS was heavily integrated into a lot of questions.

I had one Elasticache question and thankfully only one. I didn't feel very comfortable with this topic.

Monitoring was big - understanding dashboards, alarms, events and monitoring billing with billing alarms, cost explorer, budgets. Those can get confusing.

Route53 basics

VPC, NAT instance vs gateway, public vs private subnets, NACL vs Security groups and what rule might be blocking a request in various scenarios (Stephane's course covers this well).

Before the test, I followed my normal tips of boiling down my extensive notes into "the most important concepts" and used that document for review until test time. Did the testing at home w/PearsonVue...it took forever (45 min?) for a proctor to arrive but in the end, I passed! Got my full score report the next day and saw that I passed fairly easily. I worked hard on this one and won't lie, I felt rewarded with that score. I feel pretty confident in the Bonso tests as a good prep as again, I felt they skewed harder than the actual exam.

I hope this is helpful and would love to hear if this guide assists anyone succeed, if only to build confidence going in. Use the resources, study hard, and get this one behind you!
