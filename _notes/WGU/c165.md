# Integrated Physical Sciences - C165

Scientific Law - No experiments have ever contradicted this
Scientific Theory - Well accepted scientific explination

Must Know
	Conservation of Energy
	Behavior of Matter
	Structure of Matter
	The Earths Structure
	The Earths Atmosphere

3 Types of Rock
	Igneous - (firey) formed when magma or lava cools.
		 Granate is formed with pressure when igneous cools
	Sedimentary - Formed when small particles collect over a long period of time, forming layers. Pressure is involved.
		Limestome, Shale and Sand Stone are examples of sedimentary Rock
	Metamorphic - Formed by changes in extreme pressure and tempatures
		Shale becomes Slate, Sandstone becomes Quartzite, Limestone becomes marble.

Rock Cycle

Earths Atmosphere
78% nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% Other
Troposphere is the lower layer of the atmosphere
	50+ Miles - Thermosphere
	                 - Mesosphere
	25 Miles    - Stratosphere
	                 - Troposphere
	0 Miles      - The Ground
