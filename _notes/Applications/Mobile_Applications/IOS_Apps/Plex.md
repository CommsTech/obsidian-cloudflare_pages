From there find the settings icon that looks like a Gear on the menu screen that slides out from the left.

We have to change a few things here,  First click on Remote Streaming, now you'll notice that there isn't an option for Original or Maximum like a lot of the other device.  That's because it's hidden by default.

-   Select the Show All menu option from the list.

Then you will see the option we are looking for:

-   Select Maximum

Hit the < in the upper left and you will return to this screen, make sure your selections match these below:

-   Automatically Adjust Quality: **DISABLED**
-   Limit Cellular Data: 0.7 Mpbs, 320p
-   Remote Streaming: **Maximum**
-   Home Streaming: **Maximum**
