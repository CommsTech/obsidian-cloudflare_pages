# ipfs

> The InterPlanetary File System (**IPFS**) is a protocol, hypermedia and file sharing peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting IPFS hosts.IPFS can among others replace the location based hypermedia server protocols http and https to distribute the World Wide Web.The more IPFS clients, that requests and gets data, the more IPFS clients can share data. Therefore the IPFS embraces the functionality of a CDN.
