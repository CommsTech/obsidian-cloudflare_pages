# IDRAC 6

if you get the following error message. watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drhSo9Xl9M0) video for the solution

Here is an example of a modified java file for idrac access on windows 10
File is located @ C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_331\lib\security
java.security
```
# tryLast
#    KDCs in the blacklist are always tried after those not on the list.
#
# tryLess[:max_retries,timeout]
#    KDCs in the blacklist are still tried by their order in the configuration,
#    but with smaller max_retries and timeout values. max_retries and timeout
#    are optional numerical parameters (default 1 and 5000, which means once
#    and 5 seconds). Please notes that if any of the values defined here is
#    more than what is defined in krb5.conf, it will be ignored.
#
# Whenever a KDC is detected as available, it is removed from the blacklist.
# The blacklist is reset when krb5.conf is reloaded. You can add
# refreshKrb5Config=true to a JAAS configuration file so that krb5.conf is
# reloaded whenever a JAAS authentication is attempted.
#
# Example,
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLess:2,2000
krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast

# All DisabledAlgorithms expressions are processed in the order defined in the
# property.  This requires lower keysize constraints to be specified
# before larger keysize constraints of the same algorithm.  For example:
# "RSA keySize < 1024 & jdkCA, RSA keySize < 2048".
#
# Note: The algorithm restrictions do not apply to trust anchors or
# self-signed certificates.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by Oracle's PKIX implementation. It
# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# Example:
#   jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048
#
#
jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, SHA1 jdkCA & usage TLSServer, \
    RSA keySize < 1024, DSA keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, \
    include jdk.disabled.namedCurves

# Legacy algorithms for certification path (CertPath) processing and
# signed JAR files.
#

# The syntax is the same as the "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms" and
# "jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms" security properties.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference
# implementation. It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other
# implementations.

jdk.security.legacyAlgorithms=SHA1, \
    RSA keySize < 2048, DSA keySize < 2048

#
# Algorithm restrictions for signed JAR files
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
# for signed JAR validation.  For example, "MD2" is generally no longer
# considered to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section describes the
# mechanism for disabling algorithms based on algorithm name and/or key length.
# JARs signed with any of the disabled algorithms or key sizes will be treated
# as unsigned.

# For example, the cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA uses RSA as the
# key exchange algorithm, AES_128_CBC (128 bits AES cipher algorithm in CBC
# mode) as the cipher (encryption) algorithm, and SHA-1 as the message digest
# algorithm for HMAC.
#
# The LegacyAlgorithm can be one of the following standard algorithm names:
#     1. JSSE cipher suite name, e.g., TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
#     2. JSSE key exchange algorithm name, e.g., RSA
#     3. JSSE cipher (encryption) algorithm name, e.g., AES_128_CBC
#     4. JSSE message digest algorithm name, e.g., SHA
#
# See SSL/TLS specifications and "Java Cryptography Architecture Standard
# Algorithm Name Documentation" for information about the algorithm names.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
# There is no guarantee the property will continue to exist or be of the
# same syntax in future releases.
#
# Example:
#   jdk.tls.legacyAlgorithms=DH_anon, DES_CBC, SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
#
jdk.tls.legacyAlgorithms= \
        K_NULL, C_NULL, M_NULL, \
        DH_anon, ECDH_anon, \
        RC4_128, RC4_40, DES_CBC, DES40_CBC, \
        3DES_EDE_CBC

# For AlgConstraint, Uri is the algorithm URI String that is not allowed.
# See the XML Signature Recommendation for more information on algorithm
# URI Identifiers. For KeySizeConstraint, KeyAlg is the standard algorithm
# name of the key type (ex: "RSA"). If the MaxTransformsConstraint,
# MaxReferencesConstraint or KeySizeConstraint (for the same key type) is
# specified more than once, only the last entry is enforced.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation. It
# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
