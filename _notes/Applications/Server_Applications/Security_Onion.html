<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Installing Wazuh With Security Onion</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As detailed in my previous <a href="https://noctedefensor.com/security-onion-with-hyper-v/">post</a>,&nbsp; Security Onion provides a very capable network monitoring solution. It’s capability can be enhanced by installing Wazuh with the Security Onion. Wazuh is a Host intrusion detection and prevention system.&nbsp; It can be installed as a very capable stand-alone product or in this case integrated with Security Onion. The Wazuh version that is currently integrated with Security Onion is 3.13.1. Due to this integration, the procedures for configuring Wazuh and its capabilities are slightly different then what would be expected with a stand-alone installation.&nbsp; This post will provide detailed instructions with screenshots of how to install and configure a Wazuh Agent as well as Microsoft Sysmon in conjunction with the Security Onion. This will provide excellent host intrusion detection capabilities as well as basic host intrusion prevention capabilities.&nbsp; I will be using the SwiftonSecurity Default Sysmon Configuration template.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Wazuh Agent Installation Instructions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Prepare the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Security Onion includes a firewall that locks down all traffic by default. Prior to installing the Wazuh agent, We need to run <code><strong>so-allow</strong></code> to enable agent traffic from the host we intend to install the agent on to reach the Wazuh Manager.&nbsp; You will need to allow <code>Wazuh registration service port 1515/tcp</code> and <code>Wazuh agent port 1514/tcp</code>.&nbsp; Run this command from the Security Onion command line.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1140px;"><img src="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/So-Allow-1024x369.png" alt="This shows the menu of the so-allow commandhe" srcset="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/So-Allow-1024x369.png 1024w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/So-Allow-300x108.png 300w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/So-Allow-768x277.png 768w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/So-Allow.png 1461w" sizes="100vw" width="880"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2. Register an Agent with the Wazuh Manager</strong></h3>
<p>Because of the<code> so-allow firewall, this command will differ slightly then what's found in the Wazuh documentation. Refer to the Security Onion Documentation Wazuh Section. The command is <strong>sudo so-wazuh-agent-manage.</strong> You will need to know the IP address from your intended host.&nbsp; This command is run from the Security Onion command line. Don't exit the agent-manage menu as we will do other actions next.&nbsp;</code></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1140px;"><img src="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MyNewAgent-1024x519.png" alt="Picture of the menu for Wazuh-Agent-manage" srcset="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MyNewAgent-1024x519.png 1024w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MyNewAgent-300x152.png 300w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MyNewAgent-768x390.png 768w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MyNewAgent.png 1183w" sizes="100vw" width="880"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3. Extract Agent Key from Manager</strong></h3>
<p>While we are in the <code>so-wazuh-agent-manage</code> menu we extract&nbsp; the key for the agent we just added. We will need this later to input into the agent configuration on the host.&nbsp; Select “E” and then enter the ID of the agent you just added. Once the key is outputted on the terminal, highlight and copy it. Paste that key into a note document for later use.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1140px;"><img src="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Extracted-Key-1-1024x321.png" alt="" srcset="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Extracted-Key-1-1024x321.png 1024w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Extracted-Key-1-300x94.png 300w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Extracted-Key-1-768x241.png 768w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Extracted-Key-1-1536x482.png 1536w" sizes="100vw" width="880"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>4. Download the Agent MSI from the SOC console.</strong></h3>
<p>Security Onion packages the Wazuh Agent and provides it for download from the SOC menu. To access this menu, you will need to use <code>so-allow</code> to allow your target host access to the SOC page via the browser. Alternatively, you can download the MSI via the analyst machine you gave firewall access to in initial Security Onion setup. Then, you can transfer the agent msi file to the intended host via other means such as USB, email, or network share.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>5. Run the Wazuh Agent MSI</strong></h3>
<p>Once you’ve transfered the MSI to your target machine, run it by right clicking it and selecting “run as administrator.” The Wazuh Installation Wizard will then run. Ensure that you select the option to run the configuration utility after installation.&nbsp; In the Agent-Manage configuration utility GUI you will enter the Security Onion IP address AND the key you extracted and copied into the note document earlier. The “manage” drop down menu contains the options “start, stop, restart and status” After you’ve entered the Security Onion IP and the agent key, select “start” from the “manage” drop down menu.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you’d ever need to return to the agent-manager utility you can open it by running C:\Program files (x86)\ossec-agent\win32ui.exe</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sysmon Installation and Wazuh Integration</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, your Wazuh agent is installed and should be in communication with the manager. It is now gathering, shipping, and analyzing standard Windows Event logs. Its also performing file integrity monitoring, Compliance/vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection, and basic intrusion prevention actions.&nbsp; If we go one step further and install Sysmon and configure Wazuh to gather and analyze Sysmon logs, we will be greatly increasing our log analysis capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1.Download Sysmon and SwiftonSecurity Sysmon Template</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Download and extract Sysmon from Microsoft.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml">sysmonconfig-export.xml</a> from the SwiftonSecurity Github</li>
  <li>Place both the <a href="https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml">sysmonconfig-export.xml</a> and the sysmon.exe in the same folder.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1140px;"><img src="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SysmonInFolder-1024x124.png" alt="" srcset="https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SysmonInFolder-1024x124.png 1024w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SysmonInFolder-300x36.png 300w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SysmonInFolder-768x93.png 768w, https://noctedefensor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SysmonInFolder.png 1267w" sizes="100vw" width="880"></figure>
