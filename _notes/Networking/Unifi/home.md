I utilize Unifi for my 10G Agg switch as well as my Wifi APs. I know i know a cisco guy should stay with cisco and away from the GUIs but unifi just makes it so simple and reliable. I know if i bought some cisco APs I would tinker a ton more so in a way this is more reliable beacuse I touch it less.

If anyone knows a trick to get this USP Plug adopted please let me know otherwise i will just leave it on my dashboard as a reminder of my failure as a net tech.
