# About Me
I have 17 years in information technologies. 12 of which are directly related to electronic systems repair. For the past 5 Years I have been the lead network architect for a fortune 500 Organization. I hold multiple certifications from lean six sigma to aws cloud and all the comptia certs in between. 

I built this wiki to expand my knowledge of systems and document my experiences. I hope this help others in the field, My goal is to save others the headache I have learned in my past experiences.
